[Integrity Programs]    
The basic mechanical integrity programs are good

[ITM Strategy]
- Non-critical: Predictive
- Critical: Condition based, predictive/preventative as required by MSHA
CMMS: SAP

[Steam Turbines (Mechanical)] (x8)(N+2)
Inspection (Minor): S/A    
Dismantle (Major): A
O/S: A

[Pressure Vessels]
JI: FM Global
NDE: Annual
Type: Eddy Current
Thickness: Tracking by NDE
Anode & Cathode: Protection installed 2017 and has reduced tank wall corrosion issues.

[Vib]
Scope: All rotating eqpt (1500+)
Manual: M
Continuous: W/M/Q (criticality) - data reviewed/assessed
Note 1: All vib is scheduled to become continuous by 2025, and upgraded from Bently Nevada software 3300 to the 3500 (more capability).
Note 2: All critical assets are cont. monitored.

[Lube Oil]
Sampled: Q. M (critical)
Note: A new oil, 10,000 wt. it is being used (all by 2023)
- Previous: 1,500 wt. oil is used to lubricate the drive and pinion gears.  

[Controls & Safety Devices (C&SD)]
Critical Rotating Eqpt: e.g., hoists, mine shaft vent fans, crystallizer vapor compressors, calciners, dryers, MFWP [steam turbines (mech)].
Hi Vib: Warnings, Alarms, Trips
Hi Temp - lube oil: Warnings, Alarms, Trips.
- The loss of mine shaft ventilation fan - lube oil pressure causes a trip. (Installed redundant fan, two vent sets)
- Testing: at least Annual, startups and shutdowns.
